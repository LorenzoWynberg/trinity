### Story 1.1.1: Create Go workspace structure
**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Created `go.work` with use directives for core and cli modules
- Created `core/go.mod` (module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/core)
- Created `core/core.go` with Version variable
- Created `cli/go.mod` with replace directive for local core reference
- Created `cli/cmd/trinity/main.go` importing core module
- Verified go work sync and go build succeed

**Learnings:**
- Go workspaces require at least one .go file with package declaration in each module
- replace directive needed in cli/go.mod for local development
