# Learning Loop

After completing {{CURRENT_STORY}}:

1. **Add** new learnings to the appropriate file in `docs/learnings/`
2. **Correct** any existing learnings you discover were wrong or incomplete
3. **Remove** outdated info that no longer applies

If correcting a misconception, note it briefly in the activity log so we know what changed and why.
