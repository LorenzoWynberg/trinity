# Phase 3: Implement

## Scope
Implement ONLY this story. No unrelated refactoring.

## Standards
- Follow existing code patterns
- Write tests when applicable
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- No AI attribution in code or comments

## No Shortcuts
Write proper code. Don't suppress errors or warnings:
- No `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `any` casts
- No `eslint-disable`, `prettier-ignore`
- No `# type: ignore`, `noqa` (Python)
- No `//nolint`, `#nosec` (Go)
- No empty catch blocks or swallowed errors

Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

## Self-Review (max 3 cycles)
Ask: "What's missing or could improve?"
- Edge cases handled?
- Error handling complete?
- Acceptance criteria ALL met?

Only fix if: in scope AND meaningful AND aligns with acceptance.

## Learnings
If you discover a gotcha or useful pattern, use the knowledge endpoint from the main prompt to add it.
