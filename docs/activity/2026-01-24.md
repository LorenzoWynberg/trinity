## STORY-1.1.2: Create CLI entrypoint with Cobra

### What was done
- Modified `cli/cmd/trinity/main.go` to use spf13/cobra framework
- Created root command with descriptive help text
- Added github.com/spf13/cobra v1.10.2 as a direct dependency
- Connected version output to core.Version constant
- Verified `go work sync` succeeds
- Verified `go build ./cli/cmd/trinity` produces binary
- Verified `./trinity --help` shows usage with getting started guide
- Verified `./trinity --version` shows version 0.1.0

### Files modified
- `cli/cmd/trinity/main.go` - Cobra-based CLI entrypoint
- `cli/go.mod` - Added spf13/cobra dependency

### Acceptance criteria met
- [x] cli/cmd/trinity/main.go exists
- [x] Uses github.com/spf13/cobra for CLI
- [x] Root command with basic help text
- [x] go build ./cli/cmd/trinity produces binary
