## STORY-1.1.1: Create Go workspace structure

### What was done
- Created `go.work` file at repo root with Go 1.23
- Added `use` directives for `./cli` and `./core`
- Created `core/go.mod` with module `github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/core`
- Created `cli/go.mod` with module `github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/cli`
- CLI module requires and replaces core module for local development
- Added `core/core.go` with package declaration and version constant
- Verified `go work sync` succeeds

### Files created/modified
- `go.work` - Go workspace configuration
- `core/go.mod` - Core module definition
- `core/core.go` - Package entry point with version
- `cli/go.mod` - CLI module definition with core dependency

### Acceptance criteria met
- [x] go.work file at root with use directives for core, cli
- [x] core/go.mod with module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/core
- [x] cli/go.mod with module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/cli
- [x] cli imports core module
- [x] go work sync succeeds

### Learnings
- Go workspaces (`go.work`) allow multi-module repos without publishing
- Use `replace` directive in go.mod for local module references
- Version `v0.0.0` with replace is standard pattern for unpublished modules
