# Ralph Progress Log - Trinity v0.1

This file tracks progress on building Trinity v0.1 using the autonomous development loop.

## STORY-1.1.1: Create Go workspace structure
Date: 2026-01-24
Status: COMPLETED

### Changes
- Created `go.work` at root with `use ./core` and `use ./cli` directives
- Created `core/go.mod` with module `github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/core`
- Created `core/core.go` with basic package and Version constant
- Created `cli/go.mod` with module `github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/cli`
- Created `cli/cmd/trinity/main.go` that imports and uses core module
- Added replace directive in cli/go.mod for local development

### Learnings
- Go workspaces need replace directives in individual modules to avoid version lookup failures during `go work sync`
- The workspace approach cleanly separates core logic from CLI while allowing local development

### Verification
- `go work sync` succeeds
- `go build ./cli/cmd/trinity` produces binary
- Binary runs and displays core version

## Project Started
Date: 2026-01-23
Goal: Build Trinity v0.1 - CLI MVP with autonomous development loop

### Phase Overview
- Phase 1: Foundation (Go workspace, CLI scaffold, config)
- Phase 2: Database Layer (SQLite, migrations, all tables)
- Phase 3: Claude & Git Integration (invocation, signals, git ops)
- Phase 4: Prompts (templates, schemas, placeholders)
- Phase 5: Loop Logic (story selection, execution, recovery)
- Phase 6: CLI Commands (init, analyze, plan, run, status, internal)
- Phase 7: Polish (UX, docs, testing)
