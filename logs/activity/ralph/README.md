# Ralph Activity Logs

Documentation of Ralph's own development and improvements.

## Purpose

These logs document work done ON Ralph itself (the autonomous development loop), NOT work done BY Ralph. This includes:
- Ralph CLI features and improvements
- Dashboard development

## Note

Ralph does NOT write to this folder. Ralph writes Trinity story progress to `logs/activity/trinity/`.

This folder is for human documentation about Ralph's development.
