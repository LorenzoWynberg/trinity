# Ralph Activity Log - 2026-01-30

## Feature: Autopilot auto-continue with graceful stop

**Time:** 2026-01-30 ~21:00 SAST

### What was done

Completed the autopilot mode implementation in the Run Modal with auto-continue behavior and graceful stop option.

### Changes

1. **Auto-continue in autopilot mode** - When a story completes in autopilot mode, automatically starts the next story instead of showing the Done step

2. **Graceful stop option** - Added "Stop after this story" button in the Execute step during autopilot:
   - Shows yellow confirmation banner when clicked
   - Cancel button to resume autopilot
   - When story completes with stop requested, shows Done step with "Autopilot stopped as requested" message

3. **Execution logs persist** - Log history is preserved across stories in autopilot mode so you can see the full run history

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/dashboard/src/components/run-modal.tsx` - Added auto-continue logic in `handleRunResponse` and stopAfterCurrent state
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-dashboard/execution.md` - Updated documentation with autopilot behavior
