# Ralph Activity Log - 2026-01-27

## Knowledge Base: PRD Structure Documentation

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~11:00 CR

### What was done

Added comprehensive PRD structure documentation to the Ralph knowledge base. The existing docs covered CLI usage, workflows, and FAQ well, but lacked documentation explaining how the actual PRD files are structured.

**New documentation covers:**
- File organization (versioned JSON files: v0.1.json, v1.0.json, v2.0.json)
- Top-level structure (title, shortTitle, description, phases, epics, stories)
- Phase and epic definitions (separate arrays, not nested)
- Complete story schema with required and optional fields
- Story ID format (`1.2.3` numeric vs Trinity's planned `STORY-1.2.3`)
- Dependency syntax (same-version, cross-version, phase/epic/story refs)
- Two-stage completion (`passes` vs `merged` explained in detail)
- Human testing gates workflow
- External dependencies (`external_deps` and `external_deps_report`)
- State.json schema for runtime state tracking
- Complete story example showing all fields

### Files created

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/prd-structure.md` - PRD file structure documentation

### Files modified

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/index.json` - Added prd-structure page to navigation

## Checkpoint System for Resume Functionality

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~16:00 CR

### What was done

Implemented a checkpoint system for Ralph CLI that tracks progress at each major phase. When Ralph crashes or times out during Claude execution, the `--resume` flag now knows which phase to skip to instead of restarting from scratch.

**Checkpoint stages:**
- `branch_created` - Story selected, branch ready
- `validation_complete` - Story validated, deps checked
- `claude_started` - Claude invoked (can't resume mid-Claude)
- `claude_complete` - Signal detected, ready for PR
- `pr_created` - PR exists, waiting for merge

**State functions added to state.elv:**
- `save-checkpoint` - Save checkpoint with story ID, stage, timestamp, attempt, and stage-specific data
- `get-checkpoint` - Retrieve a specific checkpoint
- `has-checkpoint` - Check if a checkpoint exists
- `clear-checkpoints` - Remove all checkpoints for a story

**Resume logic in ralph.elv:**
- When `--resume` is passed, checks for existing checkpoints
- Skips to the appropriate phase based on most advanced checkpoint
- `pr_created` or `claude_complete` → skip to PR flow
- `validation_complete` → skip to Claude execution
- `branch_created` → skip to validation

**Checkpoint data stored:**
- `branch_created`: branch name, current commit
- `validation_complete`: clarification text (if any)
- `claude_started`: attempt number
- `claude_complete`: signal type, commit hash
- `pr_created`: PR URL

**Checkpoint cleanup:**
- Cleared when story completes (merged)
- Cleared when story is blocked
- Cleared during `--retry-clean`

**Bug fix - Elvish pipeline pattern:**
- Fixed `slurp | str:trim-space` pattern (causes arity mismatch)
- Correct pattern: `str:trim-space (... | slurp)` (nested, not piped)
- Fixed in ralph.elv and claude.elv

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/state.elv` - Added checkpoint functions (save, get, has, clear)
- `tools/ralph/cli/ralph.elv` - Added checkpoint saves at 5 phases, resume logic, checkpoint clears
- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/claude.elv` - Fixed slurp|str:trim-space pattern

## Checkpoint Documentation & Elvish Gotcha

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~17:00 CR

### What was done

Added comprehensive documentation for the checkpoint/recovery system and documented the Elvish pipeline gotcha discovered during implementation.

**New chapter - Recovery & Resume:**
- Checkpoint stages and data structures
- Resume modes (basic, fresh start, retry-clean)
- Common recovery scenarios (timeout, Ctrl+C, crash, stuck story)
- Debugging tips

**Elvish gotcha documented:**
- `slurp | str:trim-space` doesn't work (arity mismatch)
- Must use `str:trim-space (... | slurp)` instead
- This was a latent bug in claude.elv (caught by try/catch)

### Files created

- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/recovery.md` - Recovery & Resume chapter

### Files modified

- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/index.json` - Added recovery page to navigation
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/cli-reference.md` - Simplified checkpoints section, links to recovery chapter
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/faq.md` - Updated resume answer
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/prd-structure.md` - Added checkpoint structure to state.json schema
- `docs/gotchas/elvish/index.md` - Added slurp|str:trim-space gotcha

## Validation Timing Fix

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~18:00 CR

### What was done

Moved story validation and external deps checks BEFORE branch creation for new stories. Previously, if a user skipped during validation, the branch had already been created (wasted).

**Before:**
1. Select story
2. Create branch ← wasted if user skips
3. Validate story
4. If skip → branch was created for nothing

**After:**
1. Select story
2. Validate story
3. Check external deps
4. If skip at any point → no branch created
5. Create branch only when proceeding

**Implementation details:**
- Added `validation-done` flag to track if validation already done this iteration
- New stories: validation + ext deps before branch creation
- Resume/continue: old validation block still runs (for cases without checkpoints)
- Checkpoint saves adjusted: `validation_complete` saved after branch for new stories

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/ralph.elv` - Restructured validation timing, added validation-done flag

## Smarter Retry with Failure Context

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~19:00 CR

### What was done

Implemented smart retry functionality that tracks failure reasons and injects context into retry prompts. After 2 failures with the same error, automatically prompts user for feedback instead of blindly retrying.

**State tracking added:**
- `last_error` - The error message from the most recent failure
- `failure_count` - Number of consecutive failures with the same error

**New state functions in state.elv:**
- `record-failure` - Track a failure, increment count if same error, reset if different
- `clear-failure` - Clear failure tracking (on success or story change)
- `get-failure-info` - Get current error and count

**Failure tracking points:**
- Claude timeout → "Timeout after Xs - story may be too complex"
- Claude error → "Claude error: <reason>"
- Story blocked signal → "Story blocked - Claude output <story-blocked> signal"

**Retry behavior:**
- Attempt 2+: Check for previous failure, inject context into prompt
- Attempt 3+ (same error): Auto-escalate to user with options:
  - `[f]eedback` - Open editor to provide guidance
  - `[r]etry` - Try again with failure context
  - `[s]kip` - Skip story for now

**Prompt injection:**
- New optional `&previous_failure` parameter in claude:prepare
- Adds "Previous Attempt Failed" section to prompt with:
  - The specific error message
  - Instructions to analyze and avoid the issue
  - Suggestion to try different approaches

**Cleanup:**
- Failure tracking cleared on story success
- Failure tracking cleared during --retry-clean
- pending-failure-context cleared after use in prompt

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/state.elv` - Added last_error/failure_count fields, record-failure/clear-failure/get-failure-info functions
- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/claude.elv` - Added &previous_failure parameter, prompt injection for retry context
- `tools/ralph/cli/ralph.elv` - Failure tracking at 3 points, smart retry logic before Claude execution, cleanup on success

## Structured Signal File

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~20:00 CR

### What was done

Replaced XML tag signals with a structured JSON signal file. Claude now writes `signal.json` instead of outputting XML tags in text, and Ralph reads that file for more reliable signal detection.

**Signal file schema:**
```json
{
  "status": "complete" | "blocked" | "all_complete",
  "story_id": "1.2.3",
  "files_changed": ["list", "of", "files"],
  "tests_passed": true | false,
  "message": "Reason if blocked"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- More reliable than regex parsing text output
- Richer metadata (files changed, tests passed, blocked reason)
- Easier to extend in future
- JSON parsing is deterministic

**Backwards compatibility:**
- Kept XML tag fallback in check-signals for older prompts
- Falls back to grep if signal.json doesn't exist

**Cleanup:**
- signal.json deleted after reading (in cleanup function)
- Added to .gitignore

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/instructions/completion.md` - Replaced XML tags with signal.json writing
- `tools/ralph/cli/prompts/feedback.md` - Updated all_complete reference
- `tools/ralph/cli/prompts/partials/workflow.md` - Replaced XML tags with signal.json
- `tools/ralph/cli/prompt.md` - Updated Quick Reference to show signal file
- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/claude.elv` - check-signals reads JSON first, XML fallback; cleanup deletes signal.json
- `tools/ralph/cli/ralph.elv` - Updated debug output messages
- `tools/ralph/cli/README.md` - Updated signal documentation
- `tools/ralph/cli/.gitignore` - Added signal.json

## Feedback Loop Micro-Learning Extraction

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~21:00 CR

### What was done

Added automatic extraction of "fix patterns" from feedback loops. When user provides feedback and Claude fixes it successfully, the pattern (what was wrong → what fixed it) is extracted as a gotcha.

**Why this matters:**
- Feedback loops capture real mistakes and their solutions
- These "fix patterns" are often the most valuable gotchas
- Previously, only complete/blocked stories had learnings extracted

**New function in gotchas.elv:**
- `extract-feedback-learning` - Takes feedback text, gets diff of fix, asks Claude to extract reusable pattern

**Extraction prompt asks for:**
- Symptom (what user complained about)
- Cause (why it happened)
- Fix (how to avoid or fix it)

**Tracking in ralph.elv:**
- Added `last-used-feedback` variable to track feedback text
- Saved before clearing `pending-feedback`
- Called `extract-feedback-learning` after story completion when `was-feedback-refinement` is true

**Output format:**
- Gotcha is tagged with `<!-- From feedback loop on STORY-X.Y.Z -->` for traceability
- Only extracts if pattern is reusable (not too story-specific)

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/gotchas.elv` - Added extract-feedback-learning function
- `tools/ralph/cli/ralph.elv` - Track last-used-feedback, call extraction after feedback success

## Activity Log YAML Frontmatter

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~11:00 CR

### What was done

Added YAML frontmatter to activity log templates for machine-readable metadata. This enables the dashboard to query and aggregate activity data programmatically.

**Frontmatter fields:**
- `story_id` - Story being worked on
- `title` - Human-readable title
- `status` - complete/in_progress/blocked
- `started`/`completed` - Timestamps in CR timezone
- `duration_minutes` - Estimated time spent
- `version` - PRD version
- `branch` - Git branch name
- `files_changed` - List of modified files
- `tags` - Categorization tags

**Benefits:**
- Dashboard can filter by status, tags, files
- Metrics aggregation (count changes, track patterns)
- Trend analysis over time
- Still human-readable (prose below frontmatter)

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/prompts/partials/workflow.md` - Added YAML frontmatter template
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added Ralph activity log format specification
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-dashboard/activity.md` - Updated log format documentation

### Knowledge base updated

- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/activity-logs.md` - New chapter documenting activity log format
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/index.json` - Added activity-logs page to navigation

## Task-Oriented Prompt Refactor

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~11:30 CR

### What was done

Refactored the Ralph prompt system to be task-oriented, leveraging Claude Code's native task tracking capabilities. Instead of loading all instructions upfront, Claude now creates tasks for each phase and loads instructions on-demand.

**New prompt structure:**
- Main prompt defines 5 phases as tasks (understand, plan, implement, verify, complete)
- Each task references its instruction file
- Claude creates tasks upfront and progresses through them
- Task descriptions capture progress and findings

**Benefits:**
- Leaner prompts = less token usage
- Visible progress in Claude Code UI
- On-demand instruction loading
- Clear completion criteria per phase

**Files consolidated:**
- Removed `rules.md` (content moved to prompt.md)
- Removed `gotchas.md` (content moved to completion.md)
- Removed `prompts/partials/workflow.md` (no longer needed)

### Files modified

- `tools/ralph/cli/prompt.md` - Complete rewrite to task-oriented structure
- `tools/ralph/cli/prompts/feedback.md` - Updated to match task-oriented style
- `tools/ralph/cli/instructions/context.md` - Cleaned up, fixed book paths
- `tools/ralph/cli/instructions/completion.md` - Merged documentation updates from gotchas.md
- `tools/ralph/cli/instructions/activity-log.md` - Added YAML frontmatter
- `tools/ralph/cli/lib/claude.elv` - Removed workflow partial loading

### Files removed

- `tools/ralph/cli/instructions/rules.md`
- `tools/ralph/cli/instructions/gotchas.md`
- `tools/ralph/cli/prompts/partials/workflow.md`
- `tools/ralph/cli/prompts/partials/` (directory)

### Knowledge base updated

- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/prompt-system.md` - New chapter documenting prompt architecture
- `docs/knowledge/ralph-cli/index.json` - Added prompt-system page
