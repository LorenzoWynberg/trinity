# Ralph Activity Log - 2026-01-27

## Knowledge Base: PRD Structure Documentation

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~11:00 CR

### What was done

Added comprehensive PRD structure documentation to the Ralph knowledge base. The existing docs covered CLI usage, workflows, and FAQ well, but lacked documentation explaining how the actual PRD files are structured.

**New documentation covers:**
- File organization (versioned JSON files: v0.1.json, v1.0.json, v2.0.json)
- Top-level structure (title, shortTitle, description, phases, epics, stories)
- Phase and epic definitions (separate arrays, not nested)
- Complete story schema with required and optional fields
- Story ID format (`1.2.3` numeric vs Trinity's planned `STORY-1.2.3`)
- Dependency syntax (same-version, cross-version, phase/epic/story refs)
- Two-stage completion (`passes` vs `merged` explained in detail)
- Human testing gates workflow
- External dependencies (`external_deps` and `external_deps_report`)
- State.json schema for runtime state tracking
- Complete story example showing all fields

### Files created

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/prd-structure.md` - PRD file structure documentation

### Files modified

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/index.json` - Added prd-structure page to navigation

## Knowledge Base: Documentation Audit & Improvements

- Added missing `version` field to state schema
- Added missing `checkpoints` field to state schema

**New Advanced Features documentation:**
- Reverse dependency management (`--auto-add-reverse-deps`)
- Learning extraction and gotchas system (30-day compaction)
- Release workflow with hotfix loop
- Duplicate detection (expands on FAQ)
