# Ralph Activity Log - 2026-01-27

## Knowledge Base: PRD Structure Documentation

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~11:00 CR

### What was done

Added comprehensive PRD structure documentation to the Ralph knowledge base. The existing docs covered CLI usage, workflows, and FAQ well, but lacked documentation explaining how the actual PRD files are structured.

**New documentation covers:**
- File organization (versioned JSON files: v0.1.json, v1.0.json, v2.0.json)
- Top-level structure (title, shortTitle, description, phases, epics, stories)
- Phase and epic definitions (separate arrays, not nested)
- Complete story schema with required and optional fields
- Story ID format (`1.2.3` numeric vs Trinity's planned `STORY-1.2.3`)
- Dependency syntax (same-version, cross-version, phase/epic/story refs)
- Two-stage completion (`passes` vs `merged` explained in detail)
- Human testing gates workflow
- External dependencies (`external_deps` and `external_deps_report`)
- State.json schema for runtime state tracking
- Complete story example showing all fields

### Files created

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/prd-structure.md` - PRD file structure documentation

### Files modified

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/index.json` - Added prd-structure page to navigation

## Knowledge Base: Documentation Audit & Improvements

**Time:** 2026-01-27 ~12:00 CR

### What was done

Audited Ralph implementation against documentation to identify gaps and inaccuracies. Found several undocumented features and missing flags, then updated docs to match actual code.

**CLI Reference updates:**
- Added missing `--refine-prd [ID]` flag with examples
- Added missing `--add-stories "desc"` flag with examples
- Improved descriptions for all flags to match help text in ui.elv
- Added "PRD Management Flags" section

**PRD Structure updates:**
- Clarified story ID format - both `1.2.3` and `STORY-1.2.3` work (normalized internally)
- Added missing `version` field to state schema
- Added missing `checkpoints` field to state schema

**New Advanced Features documentation:**
- Reverse dependency management (`--auto-add-reverse-deps`)
- Learning extraction and gotchas system (30-day compaction)
- Release workflow with hotfix loop
- Duplicate detection (expands on FAQ)
- Story validation and clarification
- Related story updates

### Files created

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/advanced-features.md` - Documentation for undocumented advanced features

### Files modified

- `docs/knowledge/ralph/cli-reference.md` - Added missing flags, improved descriptions
- `docs/knowledge/ralph/prd-structure.md` - Clarified story IDs, added state fields
- `docs/knowledge/ralph/index.json` - Added advanced-features page to navigation
