## 1.1.1: Create Go workspace structure

**Phase:** 1 | **Epic:** 1 | **Version:** v1.0
**Started:** 2026-01-25 09:25
**Branch:** feat/story-1.1.1

### What was done
- Created `go.work` file at repository root with use directives for core and cli modules
- Created `core/` directory with `go.mod` (module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/core)
- Created `core/core.go` with Version variable as placeholder
- Created `cli/` directory with `go.mod` (module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/cli)
- Set up `cli/go.mod` with replace directive to reference local core module
- Created `cli/cmd/trinity/main.go` that imports and uses the core module
- Verified `go work sync` succeeds
- Verified `go build ./cli/cmd/trinity` produces working binary

### Files modified
- `go.work` - New file: Go workspace configuration
- `core/go.mod` - New file: Core module definition
- `core/core.go` - New file: Core package placeholder with Version variable
- `cli/go.mod` - New file: CLI module definition with core dependency
- `cli/cmd/trinity/main.go` - New file: CLI entrypoint that imports core

### Acceptance criteria met
- [x] go.work file at root with use directives for core, cli
- [x] core/go.mod with module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/core
- [x] cli/go.mod with module github.com/trinity-ai-labs/trinity/cli
- [x] cli imports core module
- [x] go work sync succeeds

### Learnings
- Go workspaces require modules to have at least one Go file with package declaration
- The replace directive in cli/go.mod ensures local module references work
